# Personal Portfolio Project

This is the repo containing code for the website to display other projects and works that I have undertaken.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Code

### Elements

Chose to use [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) to get some simple elements.

**Example**

```bash
npx shadcn-ui@latest init
npx shadcn-ui@latest add dropdown-menu
```
